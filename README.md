### Daily (Prognostics tab)

Generate a reading of transit impact on you. Copy, Paste & Prompt:
```
Describe this day based on astrological data below. Assume the most likely events, scenes, vibes that can be applied to real life: everyday issues, relationships, earnings, communication, work tasks - everything that you consider relevant. What impact will my actions have today? What can I expect from the outside world, which I don't control? Outline the picture of events, highlight the key aspects to the natal positions and describe their meaning. Write simply, no abstractions, clear examples. Don't be superficial and banal, try to synthesize. Avoid advice, drama, conditions and ambiguities, just read what is embedded in the chart's mechanisms and try to illustrate.
```

### General (Active Chart tab)

Generate a general chart reading. Copy, Paste & Prompt:
```
Tell me what kind of person it is based on the natal chart below. Do not generalize, do not give advice, avoid drama, and speak only applicable to life, with examples. If established society were to meet a newcomer with this chart, who would they encounter? Who has appeared in the world with such a chart? What will this person do, what qualities will they display, and in which areas does this person not particularly stand out?
```

Generate a general interpretation regarding **career**. Copy, Paste & Prompt:
```
What kind of career do you see in the natal chart below? Give a reading focused on professional development, without pulling in other life areas or psychology. Decode what is embedded in the aspects, synthesize them, and describe the expressed patterns uing examples and vivid, characteristic scenes. You are not describing desires, needs, or potential - only specific details of the career: professions, stages of formation, the environment, effectiveness, what will be present in the career and what will not. It is important to analyze the 10th house as the significator of public realization, and all the elements of the 10th house (the ruling planet, the sign, planets within the house, aspects to them and to the cusp of the house). Having gathered all the details, synthesize them into a unified mechanism of development, indicating what specific scenes and events are shown, what patterns and most advantageous strategies are present. Additionally, pay attention to the North Node as a vector of growth - but don‚Äôt interpret it as an instruction. Instead, suggest how it might integrate into the career, as if showing where the tailwind lies. Do not dramatize the nodal axis - the South transfers into the North, and the person has no choice but to live it out anyway. It‚Äôs important not to give advice, not to set conditions, and not to use abstractions. Write thoughtfully and in depth, so that the reading is applicable to real life and creates vivid associative imagery in the reader‚Äôs mind. I emphasize: do not give advice; the native owes you nothing. Your answer should give only an understanding of the chart. Write like this: ‚ÄúWhen reading this chart, the following likely scenarios come to mind...‚Äù
```

Generate a general interpretation regarding **your target audience**. Copy, Paste & Prompt:
```
You are an astrology consultant for a businessman. Describe the image of the client that can be seen in the businessman‚Äôs natal chart. This should be a portrait that entrepreneurs usually create when defining their target audience - the top 3 characteristic types of consumers (age, profession, requests, quality/quantity, etc.). It is important that the client is not the native himself but his opposite. It is essential to analyze the 7th house as the significator of people opposite to the native, recipients, and all elements of the 7th house (the ruling planet, the sign, planets within the house, aspects to them and to the cusp of the house). Having gathered all the details, synthesize them into a unified mechanism of interaction with partners: what specific scenes and events with them are indicated, what patterns and most advantageous strategies are shown. Indicate what is characteristic and what does not concern relations with clients among the chart data (in other words, do not drag unrelated elements into this focused question).
The final answer structure: who the typical client is, who they are not, the client‚Äôs needs, the client‚Äôs typical behavior (all according to the 7th house); then the native himself as a source of resources for the client, and what he can receive from clients (1st house); then the keys to establishing connection between the native and the client (synthesis of aspects). If possible, describe the most effective ways of promotion, negotiations, working with the target audience, building the sales funnel, etc. Do not give advice or instructions - simply describe what is indicated in the chart, with clear examples.
```

Generate a general interpretation regarding **finances**. Copy, Paste & Prompt:
```
You are an astrologer-consultant for an individual. Describe the mechanism of their income generation as encoded in the natal chart. Examine the 2nd house as the container of personal finances and active income (employment, small-scale entrepreneurship), and the 8th house as the domain of passive income and shared resources (business, investments). It is essential to analyze all elements of the 2nd-8th house axis, including their rulers, signs, planets within, and aspects to these planets and to the house cusps. After gathering all the details, synthesize them into a single mechanism that describes how financial inflows function. For example, the planetary ruler of the 2nd house indicates the most profitable motivation leading to income generation. Identify the top three income scenarios, the most likely sources of earnings, and the most characteristic areas for investment. Provide a comparative description showing how this chart differs from other possible configurations - how predisposed the individual is to wealth, what kind of wealth it is, and from which sources money is least likely to come. Where possible, describe the most effective means of increasing financial resources that are naturally supported by the chart. Do not give advice or instructions - simply describe what is inherently encoded in the chart, using clear, concrete examples.
